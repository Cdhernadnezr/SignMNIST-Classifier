# ðŸ§  Sign Language MNIST Classifier


This project documents not only the final implementation of a deep learning model for classifying American Sign Language (ASL) letters using the [SignMNIST dataset](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&status=active&id=45082), but also the reasoning behind each decision made throughout the development process â€” including chosen approaches, discarded alternatives, and the rationale for the selected methodology.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

To develop a deep learning model capable of recognizing hand gestures corresponding to 24 alphabetic letters in ASL (excluding J and Z) using image classification techniques.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **Source**: OpenML - SignMNIST
- **Images**: 28Ã—28 grayscale pixels (flattened to 784 features)
- **Pixel values**: Range from 0 to 255
- **Labels**: 0â€“25, corresponding to Aâ€“Z (excluding J = 9 and Z = 25)
- **Samples**:  
  - **Training**: 27,455 images  
  - **Test**: 7,172 images
- **Format**: CSV with rows like: `label, pixel1, pixel2, ..., pixel784`
